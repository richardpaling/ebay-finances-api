     * @param  string $filter The three filter types that can be used here are discussed below. If none of these filters are used, all recent payouts in all states are returned: payoutDate: search for payouts within a specific range of dates. The date format to use is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout?filter&#x3D;payoutDate:[2018-12-17T00:00:01.000Z..2018-12-24T00:00:01.000Z] Alternatively, the user could omit the ending date, and the date range would include the starting date and up to 90 days past that date, or the current date if the starting date is less than 90 days in the past. lastAttemptedPayoutDate: search for attempted payouts that failed within a specific range of dates. In order to use this filter, the payoutStatus filter must also be used and its value must be set to RETRYABLE_FAILED. The date format to use is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ. The same syntax used for the payoutDate filter is also used for the lastAttemptedPayoutDate filter. This filter is only applicable (and will return results) if one or more seller payouts have failed, but are retryable. payoutStatus: search for payouts in a particular state. Only one payout state can be specified with this filter. The supported payoutStatus values are as follows: INITIATED: search for payouts that have been initiated but not processed. SUCCEEDED: search for successful payouts. RETRYABLE_FAILED: search for payouts that failed, but ones which will be tried again. This value must be used if filtering by lastAttemptedPayoutDate. TERMINAL_FAILED: search for payouts that failed, and ones that will not be tried again. REVERSED: search for payouts that were reversed. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by payout status: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout?filter&#x3D;payoutStatus:{SUCCEEDED} If both the payoutDate and payoutStatus filters are used, payouts must satisfy both criteria to be returned. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/finances/types/cos:FilterField (optional)
     * @param  string $sort By default, payouts or failed payouts that match the input criteria are sorted in ascending order according to the payout date/last attempted payout date (oldest payouts returned first). To view payouts in descending order instead (most recent payouts/attempted payouts first), you would include the sort query parameter, and then set the value of its field parameter to payoutDate or lastAttemptedPayoutDate (if searching for failed, retrybable payouts). Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a payout date range in descending order: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/payout?filter&#x3D;payoutDate:[2018-12-17T00:00:01.000Z..2018-12-24T00:00:01.000Z]&amp;amp;sort&#x3D;payoutDate Payouts can only be sorted according to payout date, and can not be sorted by payout status. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/finances/types/cos:SortField (optional)
     * @param  string $limit The number of payouts to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves payouts 11 thru 20 from the result set. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first payout in the results set has an offset value of 0. Maximum: 200 Default: 20 (optional)
     * @param  string $offset This integer value indicates the actual position that the first payout returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th payout of the result set, you would set the offset value in the request to 10. In the request, you can use the offset parameter in conjunction with the limit parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 30 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves payouts 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of payouts. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first payout in the results set has an offset value of 0. Default: 0 (zero) (optional)
